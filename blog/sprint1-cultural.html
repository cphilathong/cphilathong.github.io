        <h1>Ethical decisions, and core personal values</h1>
        <p>
            Having had experience in the retail sales industry in technology, it was not uncommon to have less-knowledgeable people regarding tech come in e.g. an elderly person. 
            An Ethical decision that I have come across would be whether to upsell customers of a newer product that would definitely be an improvement over the one they 
            have now (thus spending more) or to remedy the issue with the device - say a software issue, but still maintaining the same older hardware. My decision was always giving 
            customers a choice of a new device or fixing the issue. Often the choice is me fixing the software issues (which usually should be paid for) which I end up doing 
            for free under my own discretion, which was not good for the business as well as for myself.

            Traits that I’ve inherited through culture – being it as a kiwi, west Aucklander and child of parents from Laos if I were to say what I value, I would have to say doing you best. 
            Regardless of opportunity (an important discussion to be had) what you can control in the immediate is your actions and the action to help those 
            around you too in whatever endeavour.

        <h1>Evaluation of strengths and limitations</h1>   
        <p>
            My strength and limitation regarding learning is being a very self-critical person. This means that I do have a high standard for myself which I value, this mean 
            that I strive to work to the best of my potential, this is a limitation at times however because learning and doing as you go (and failing) is so important to the 
            learning process. This uncomfortability compounded by my self-criticism stop me from achieving more of myself at times and so is a learning obstacle.

            In retail working productively with others can mean working with customers. With working with customers, it is understandable that they can be hesitant or feel stand-offish 
            to me as a retail worker as my motive for suggestion may be perceived as a conflict of interest. Strategies that I used at the time in response to resistance and tension was 
            simply asking the right question and inquiring thoughtfully about how products could impact in their lives and cater a solution to them. I think that it was effective because it 
            showed that you cared enough to give the right solution.
