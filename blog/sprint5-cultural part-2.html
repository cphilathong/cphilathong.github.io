            <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
            <p>
                I hope to use the skills I gain to develop and improve things of intrinsic value.

                What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?

            <h1>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
            <p>
                Biggest non-technical challenge I think for me would most likely be speaking in 
                front of groups and keeping focused for 9 weeks.

            <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
            <p>
                The non-technical skills I aim to nurture at EDA is confidence in communication particularly public speaking, and leadership.

            <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
            <p>
                Dev Academy has a variety of avenues of help during bootcamp that cover human and technical hardship.

                As a commitment of how Iâ€™ll manage workload, productivity is important and so reflection on what was learnt 
                that day is important to retain the information and continue to move onwards. To be an effective learner 
                also requires promoting a good learning environment not only for yourself but for others as well. 
                This requires the mindfulness and the self-awareness of yourself and to help govern your own emotions 
                and thoughts to proceed effectively onwards.
