            <h1>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h1>
            <p>An analogy for the differences between HTML and CSS would be like an illustrated book. In the book we would see the contents i.e. 
            the words and even the pictures in a book and CSS would be how you’d like the contents to to appear like the font, text-size and picture alignment. 
            </p>
            <h1>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h1>
            <p>Examples of control flow process from everyday life would be something like whether I’d bring an umbrella outside based on a condition, 
            say for instance if it were rainy I would, if it wasn’t, I wouldn’t bring the umbrella. Looping in everyday process could be shown as if I were to 
            do a simple process many times this would be repetitive – say screwing in screws the logic behind how you would do this is pretty much the same.

            <h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
            <p>The DOM is a model representation of for instance a webpage. This model allows us to 
                interact with the page in a way that it can be accessed and manipulated e.g. JavaScript for events 
            </p>
            <h1>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
            <p>Array are ordered lists of many objects. The Objects themselves may have many different properties by design. 
                This means accessing an object in an array requires a specified index and furthermore the object you select 
                may have different properties that need accessing itself.
            </p>
            <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
            <p>Functions are great way to encapsulate repetitive code thus simplifying your code. It also helps by creating 
                functionalities where you wouldn’t have to necessarily understand how the code works thus returning a solution to a complex problem.
