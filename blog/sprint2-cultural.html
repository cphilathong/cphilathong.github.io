            What is your long-term goal and or career pathway?
            </h1>
            Long term goal and or career pathway would somehow involve improving through tech, things of intrinsic 
            value in whatever capacity e.g. making it easier for essential workers to do their jobs. 
            <h1>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </h1>
            Public presentation and improving communication within a team environment. Being able to foster a team environment that aims in effectively leading to it greatest potential.
            <h1>
            A description of your own strengths and limitations
            </h1>
            I like to believe that every individual has their own quirks and styles to personality. And that stems from myself where I may not be the most outspoken demeanour but is passionate inwardly. My strength I think would be being a perceptive person. The limitations would be because I am not the most outspoken person that I would not be best at leverage and enacting in a practical sense this strength – certainly in a workplace environment. 
            <h1>
            Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
            This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
            </h1>
            Leveraging my strength and perceptivity to other. I hope to create a comfortable workplace for other learners so they themselves may learn with me at their greatest potential. This means working well with facilitators and industry/community representatives. 
            <h1>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
            </h1>
            Dev Academy has many resources that allows for avenues of help whether that be code help which could be through Slack/Colleagues/Leads or help that involves a more mindful approach.
            <h1>
            A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
            </h1>
            Just help when needed. Whether that be code help, more learning resources for extra-curricular topics – not necessarily answers but so long as there is a facilitation of learning.
            <h1>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
