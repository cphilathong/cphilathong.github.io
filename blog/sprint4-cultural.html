            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
            <p>
                When it is understood that the brain continues, long after you are born to make new neural pathways when you repeatedly practice an activity, 
                it can motivate people as they come to the realisation that you can continue to learn and gain new skills/become better at whatever you desire. 
                For me that means exercising the brain by continually practicing. This is particularly reinforced by the idea of Kata’s in the curriculum.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As Neuralplasticity involves the forming of new neural pathways, it would be apt that improving Neuralplasticity may mean maintaining optimal
                mental and physical wellbeing, which includes things like mindfulness training, fitness, diet and sleep. Another such way may be the intentional
                use of time. As we are training our brain, make it so that were not being distracted and dedicate the time to training ourselves.

            <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
            <p>
                The notion that Intelligence is developed rather than static/born with. It is relevant because it ingrains a belief that through 
                learning/struggle/practice that you improve, partnered with knowing of Neuroplasticity it should solidify this truth.

                The exploration into the subjects above didn’t really surprise me as I’ve research some of these ideas prior, in which has fostered the ideals 
                that I have now. And aim to use the mindset in the learning journey, embracing the concepts that give me mental block as training regimes that serve to improve.
