            <h1>A time in which I felt like I was stuck on a simple problem</h1>
            <p>
                In our Kata challenges one such simple problem that had me mentally blocked was the ‘buzz’ challenge. The problem required me to remove all the 
                words in a sentence that contained the word ‘buzz’. The techniques that helped me solve this problem were pseudo-coding and Console.logging. 
                This was needed to simply break down the problem into human readable language, whilst the tool of console.logging allowed me to see what each of my steps 
                resulted in/output as and where I needed to go further to solve the problem. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have learnt through this process that solving coding problems starts before even coding begins (pseudo-coding). And that debugging may require 
                a bit of resilience particularly when frustrated.
