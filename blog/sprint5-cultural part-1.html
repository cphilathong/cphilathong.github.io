            <h1>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h1>
            <p>
                 -	That for me it is quite hard to adopt new habits. <br>
                 -	Reflecting and explaining to myself or others engrains the topics.<br>
                 -	Reminding myself not to be too hard on myself.<br>
            </p>
            
            <h1>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
            <p>
                Having self-awareness and empathy is important to learning and programming because of its importance to be able to evaluate and manage yourself 
                and likely empathise some of these feelings you may have felt with others. With them in mind you decide to align your behaviours with the values 
                that aim to foster a team environment that seeks its most optimal potential.   
            </p>

            <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
            <p>
                The amount of time reflecting on the core learning material and focusing to remind yourself to be intentional in adding these tools to your repertoire of skills.
            </p>
            <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
            <p>
                The challenging aspects of core learning was turning what I had received as knowledge into habitual thinking.
            </p>
            
            <h1>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
            <p>
                As a programming school its important that you create well rounded programmers entering the industry. That the graduates have a great 
                reputation in contributing to the betterment of the workplace culture and fit.
            </p>

            <h1>
                 Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </h1>
            <p>
                I donâ€™t think the core material was a waste of time as I found that I was able to balance the time spent programming well with the time 
                reflecting on the core learning and the technical things being learnt. I would add that if the core material did anything, it was that It had 
                improved practicing programming instead i.e. growth mindset.
